# DM18-Toy-Problems

This repository is for the storage of and reference to sample toy problems to be used during the morning mentor workshops of DM18.

Below you will find a list of toy problem titles, including a short description and/or a link to the problem itself.  We will attempt to the extent possible to separate the toy problems into "Beginner" and "Advanced" groupings, for ease of access.

Please mark any toy problems previously used in the current DM.
