# DM18-Toy-Problems

This repository is for the storage of and reference to sample toy problems to be used during the morning mentor workshops of DM18.

Below you will find a list of toy problem titles, including a short description and/or a link to the problem itself.  We will attempt to the extent possible to separate the toy problems into "Beginner" and "Advanced" groupings, for ease of access.
